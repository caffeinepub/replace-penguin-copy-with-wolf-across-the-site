A new LaunchRoadmap component was created (not modifying existing Roadmap.tsx), integrated into the homepage with a prominent launch button displaying March 31st, and includes a clickable modal revealing detailed launch phases. The implementation uses consistent theming, animations (useInView hook), and responsive design matching the wolf/pack aesthetic.",
