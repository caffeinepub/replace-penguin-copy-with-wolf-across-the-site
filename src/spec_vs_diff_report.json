  "summary": "Implemented centralized social link configuration and updated Community section to render 5 social platform items as external links with disabled state when URLs are empty. Footer Community links were partially updated to use the same configuration, but the diff truncation prevents confirming that Twitter/X and Reddit footer links are present and correctly configured.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Footer community links include Discord, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, and Reddit, each pointing to the appropriate external URL and opening in a new tab with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".",
      "reason": "Footer.tsx shows Discord/Instagram/Facebook links wired to COMMUNITY_SOCIAL_LINKS with target/rel, but the diff truncates during the Twitter link and does not show Reddit at all, so it cannot be verified that all 5 requested platforms are included and correctly configured.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx (truncated at twitter link rendering)"
      ]

    {
      "description": "Updated autogenerated repository/file summary document not requested by the BuildRequest.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not mention maintaining frontend-file-summaries.txt; this appears unrelated to adding social links.",
