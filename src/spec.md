# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a pie/donut chart visualization to the “🐺 Meme Coin Style Version (Fun + Viral)” tokenomics card while keeping the existing tokenomics chart, table, and meme-style text intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a second pie/donut chart inside the Meme Coin Style tokenomics card representing the same $LWOLF allocation breakdown (Public Sale 35%, Liquidity 20%, Rewards 15%, Marketing 10%, Dev Team 10%, Airdrops 5%, Treasury 5%).
- Match the meme chart’s neon/dark styling and interaction/entrance animations to the existing Tokenomics chart (glow, hover feedback, smooth transitions) while respecting reduced-motion settings.
- Ensure the Meme Coin Style card layout remains mobile-responsive (chart and accompanying content stack cleanly without horizontal overflow).

**User-visible outcome:** In the Tokenomics section, users will continue to see the main animated chart and allocation table unchanged, and will additionally see a neon-styled pie/donut chart inside the Meme Coin Style card that visualizes the same meme allocation percentages alongside the existing meme text.
