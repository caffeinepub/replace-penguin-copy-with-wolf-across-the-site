# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add an interactive launch roadmap section to the homepage with a prominent Launch button displaying the DEX soft launch date of March 31st.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new roadmap section on the homepage with a Launch button showing March 31st DEX launch date
- Make the Launch button clickable to reveal detailed Wolf Pack launch information including soft launch on DEX (March 31st) labeled "Initial Expansion of Wolf World" and Tier 1 exchange launch approximately 3 months later (end of June)
- Integrate the roadmap section seamlessly into the existing homepage with consistent wolf/pack themed styling, animations, and responsive design

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see a prominent Launch button on the homepage roadmap section and click it to view detailed launch phases including the March 31st DEX soft launch and subsequent Tier 1 exchange launch timeline.
